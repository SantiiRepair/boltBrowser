1. Add db by pressing sign '+'

## Settings

You can change mode of converting `[]byte`. Just change functions `ConvertKey(b []byte) string` (or `ConvertValue()`) in [src/converters/converter.go](src/converters/converters.go)

__Note__: function will be used for converting all keys (or values). So, if your keys (or values) were converted from either `string` or `uint` program will crash.
